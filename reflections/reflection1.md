My personal learning goals were mainly to learn some C, and I feel like I've accomplished that, although I still don't feel very confident. I think that's alright at this point, because we've only done 3 chapters each of Head First C and Think OS. I think that our last sprint review really made us realize that we weren't spending enough time actually experimenting with the arduino part of our project, and since then we've made a lot of progress at making sounds, and have started writing code that will generate waves of different frequencies. Also, we didn't do very well at doing the reading questions together to really solidify our understanding of the reading, which we are changing for this sprint. Going into the sprint review, we had done a lot of research, but hadn't built very much for our project. It definitely could have gone better, but I think we learned a lot from it and it pushed us to get back on track.

Our team lost our original Scrum Master pretty early on when Ian dropped the class, but we have been keeping our Trello cards up to date pretty well, and doing the other ceremonies. I think that the standup ceremony has been less useful here than in other contexts, because besides readings, most of the work we have been doing has been together. That might change in the future, though, and I think it's definitely a good practice even if we all just go around and say that we read a chapter by ourselves and made square waves with everyone else.

__Question:__ List 3 reasons why virtual memory is important.

__Answer (or some answers):__ 

 It prevents two programs from assigning to the same physical address.

 It allows for non-continuous chunks of memory to be used.

 When there isn't enough RAM, virtual memory can save to disk.

 Memory errors in one process don't crash other processes running at the same time.

 This question draws off of ThinkOS 3, question 5. I think it's useful to expand it to cover other things it's useful for.
