__For Reflection 0, we'd like you to focus on the process of team formation and creating your first sprint backlog. For example, how did you each share your individual goals and combine them to form team goals? How did your team decide on a scrum master and divide other responsibilities? How did you decide what to include and omit from your sprint backlog? What are you still apprehensive about?__

I am happy with our sprint backlog, I think my team picked a well-scoped project which is really important for a first project where I don't really know what it takes to do things. Since none of us know C I am happy that we made that a main focus for this sprint; much of our backlog is just reading Head First C and Think OS, and the rest is some small tasks involving arduino, all of which seem good. I am apprehensive about how to go forward with some of the project stuff, but hopefully some of that will be clarified by learning some C and looking at what people have done before.
