  /* as Stevens points out in Section 18.5 of Unix Network Programming,
     many programs with alarms have a race condition, which is that
     the alarm might go off before we get to the recvfrom, in which
     case it does nothing and the recvfrom might wait indefinitely.

     In earlier versions of this code, this problem seemed to pop
     up occasionally (although I am not positive about that).

     The use of select here solves that problem.  When the alarm
     goes off, the alarm handler sends a message through the pipe,
     which is one of the things select waits for.

     When select returns, we know that we have received a datagram
     OR the alarm has gone off OR both.  We then use rset to find
     out which, and deal with it.

     According to the specification of select, it should not be possible
     to get to the recvfrom unless there is a datagram waiting, and
     therefore the recvfrom should never block.  Nevertheless, it sometimes
     does, which is why, when we opened it, we set the NONBLOCK flag
     and why, if it fails (errno = EAGAIN) we just go on. */
