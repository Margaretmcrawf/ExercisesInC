'This said, his wat'ry eyes he did dismount,
  Whose sights till then were levelled on my face;
  Each cheek a river running from a fount
  With brinish current downward flowed apace.
  O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!
  what what what
  Who glazed with crystal crystal crystal gate the glowing roses
  what what what what what what
  That flame through water which their hue encloses.
